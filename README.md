# Computer technician guide

 A *computer technician guide* to repair your friends and family computer. You are "the" tech guy in the family, don't you?

 One of the hallmarks of our age is the decline of the do-it-yourselfer in favor of the hire-an-expert-to-do-it-insteader. Toilet not flushing? Hire a plumber. Porch falling down? Hire a carpenter. Lights on the blink? Hire an electrician.

 You could argue, as many people have done, that a return to a DIY ethos would be good for society and good for the soul. I like to DIY. Also, I'm a Computer Science graduate, so I get often called as "the" tech guy in family and circle of friends.

# NOTE

This guide is in early alpha stage, nothing is ready yet.

## Motivation

Everybody that has worked in the Computer Science field knows it. You are "the" tech guy in the family or circle of friends.

You get the late 4 am call of a desperate aunt that needs to finish work and the computer simply wont work, or a cousin that has a new computer without operating system.

Doesn't matter if you work for NASA, or if you have twenty years working in C++, for them your work is "repair computers". They will get mad if you don't repair their computer. Even if you don't have a clue how to do it since you're into algorithms and stuff far away from the mundane software.

So well, here comes this little guide, mainly done for myself, the quick and dirty guide to fix someone's else computer at 4 am a Thursday...

This list is NOT extensive, nor has "the TRUE word of GOD himself" into it. Is just a random guide of the things that *works for me*â„¢ .

I try to use open source software, avoid bloatware, crapware, and paid software at all costs.

If you know a better way, please let me know, or better send a pull request and improve it!

For now, *this is the way*...

For new computers or *recently formated*.

1. Get Windows 10 : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10

Activate Windows10

Disable telemetry, cortana, ms store, xbox bullshit, and all the crap that win10 has...

TODO - describe HOW

## Drivers

* Snappy auto driver updater - installar: https://sdi-tool.org/

# Software for Windows  

## Remote Desktop

Adding that they always call around 2 am to 4 am, the family member in trouble is usually at the other side of the globe, so a remote desktop software is a must.

* Any Desk

* Team Viewer

* UltraVNC

Now you are into their computer... time to work, mostly automated so I don't lose my valuable time. I usually have a script with a pack with the software I'm going to use. Download the pack, run it and be done.

## Cleanup

* Bleach Bit

* Privatezilla - disable windows telemetry and general spyware from micro$oft...

Obsolete:

## Recover deleted data

I try to avoid this task, please have **BACKUPS**!

**Educate your family and friends on the importance of having BACKUPS**

* Recuva -- recover deleted files

Alternatives:

## Backups

TODO

## Virus and malware

I usually install a scanner, do the scan, then remove it and leave Windows Defender, since the hardware of my circle of friends is usually very modest and slow, so antivirus usually make it crawl.

* Avira Free - https://www.avira.com/en/free-antivirus-windows

* Spybot Free Edition - https://www.safer-networking.org/products/spybot-free-edition/
  * Has a cool "inmunization" feature. Use it.

* Windows Defender - https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10

I leave this after the full scan, inmunization, etc, removing all the others.
