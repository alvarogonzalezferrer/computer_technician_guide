# Computer technician guide

 A *computer technician guide* to repair your friends and family computer. You are "the" tech guy in the family, don't you?

# NOTE

This guide is in early alpha stage, nothing is ready yet.

## Motivation

Everybody that has worked in the Computer Science field knows it. You are "the" tech guy in the family or circle of friends.

You get the late 4 am call of a desperate aunt that needs to finish work and the computer simply wont work, or a cousin that has a new computer without operating system.

Doesn't matter if you work for NASA, or if you have twenty years working in C++, for them your work is "repair computers". They will get mad if you don't repair their computer. Even if you don't have a clue how to do it since you're into algorithms and stuff far away from the mundane software.

So well, here comes this little guide, mainly done for myself, the quick and dirty guide to fix someone's else computer at 4 am a Thursday...

This list is NOT extensive, nor has "the TRUE word of GOD himself" into it. Is just a random guide of the things that *works for me*â„¢ .

I try to use open source software, avoid bloatware, crapware, and paid software at all costs.

If you know a better way, please let me know, or better send a pull request and improve it!

For now, *this is the way*...

# Donate please

## Remote Desktop

Adding that they always call around 2 am to 4 am, the family member in trouble is usually at the other side of the globe, so a remote desktop software is a must.
